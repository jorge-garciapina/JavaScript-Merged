The thought process for modeling and solving the game involves several steps, 
including defining the game requirements, creating a game design, and implementing
the game logic using a programming language.

In terms of the game requirements, the goal is to create a game similar to the classic
arcade game Galaga, where the player controls a weapon to shoot down enemies, and the
enemies move from right to left. The game should have a start button, a shooting mechanism, 
and enemies that move and can be destroyed by the shots.

The game design involves creating a layout for the game, including the position of the weapon,
the start button, and the enemies. The design should also include the visual appearance of the
weapon, the start button, and the enemies.

To implement the game logic, object-oriented principles are involved in several parts of the
solution. Firstly, the weapon and enemies can be modeled as objects in the game, with their 
own properties such as position, appearance, and behavior. This allows for easy manipulation 
and control of these elements in the game.

Secondly, the shooting mechanism can be implemented using object-oriented principles by creating 
a class for the shots, with properties such as position and movement. This allows for easy control 
of the shots in the game and ensures that the shots behave as intended.

Finally, the collision detection between the shots and the enemies can be implemented using 
object-oriented principles. This involves checking if the positions of the shots and enemies 
intersect, and if so, destroying both the shot and the enemy.

In conclusion, object-oriented principles play a crucial role in modeling and solving the game 
by providing a structured approach to representing and controlling the elements in the game.
